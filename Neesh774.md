# Blindr

## Summary

I'm going to build a system to automatically open and close my blinds automatically, or whenever I want it to.

## Plan

I'm going to use a pulley system on the top and bottom where the wire is attached to a 3D printed clamp that's attached to the blind.
That way, I can pull and push it based on the direction that I rotate the wire on the pulleys, and the clamp will bring the blinds down
with the wire. I'll use a Raspberry Pi Pico and a motor to control the motor that rotates the pulleys.
I need 3 of each component so I can build one for each of my blinds.
